    <h2>A timeline of Dr. Djerassi's professional life:</h2>
    <div class="list" id="tribute-info">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1923 -</strong> Born in Vienna, Austria </li>
            <li><strong>1938 -</strong> Following his parents' divorce, Austria refused him citizenship. His father briefly remarried his mother in order that Carl and his mother could escape the Nazi regime and flee to Bulgaria, where he lived with his father for a year. </li>
            <li><strong>1939 -</strong> Emigrates to the United States with his mother. </li>
            <li><strong>1942-43 -</strong> Works for CIBA in New Jersey. He is issued his first patent for his work developing Pyribenzamine, one of the first commercial antihistamines</li>
            <li><strong>1945 -</strong> Earns his Ph.D. in organic chemistry from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. For his thesis, Djerassi studied the transformation of the male sex hormone testosterone into the female sex hormone estradiol.</li>
            <li><strong>1949 -</strong> His father emigrates to the United States. Djerassi becomes associate director of research at Syntex in Mexico City.</li>
            <li><strong>1951 -</strong> Works on a new synthesis of cortisone based on a chemical derivative of a Mexican wild yam. Later, he and his team synthesize norethisterone, the first highly active progestin analogue that was effective when taken by mouth. This was one of the first succesful oral contraceptives.</li>
            <li><strong>1952-59 -</strong> Serves as professor of chemistry at Wayne State University in Detroit.</li>
            <li><strong>1957 -</strong> Becomes vice president of research at Syntex in Mexico City on leave of absence from Wayne University.</li>
            <li><strong>1960 -</strong> Becomes professor of chemistry at Stanford University, a position he holds until 2002. During his time there he develops novel physical research techniques for mass spectrometry and optical rotatory dispersion. Focusing in the field of the structure of steroids, he publishes over 1200 papers.</li>
            <li><strong>1965 -</strong> Working at Stanford University alonside nobel laureate Joshua Lederberg and computer scientist Edward Feigenbaum, Djerassi helps develop the computer program DENDRAL. The program assisted in the discovery of the molecular structure of unknown organic compounds based on information from known groups of such compounds. This was one of the first uses of artificial intelligence in biomedical research</li>
            <li><strong>1968 -</strong> Starts Zoecon, a company specializing in environmentally soft methods of pest control, using modified insect growth hormones to stop insects from metamorphosing from the larval stage to the pupal and adult stages.</li>
            <li><strong>2015 -</strong> Dr. Djerassi dies at the age of 91, from complications of liver and bone cancer.</li>
